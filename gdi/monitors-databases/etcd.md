<meta name="Description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the etcd monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` uses the {ref}`Smart Agent receiver <smartagent-receiver>` with the etcd monitor type to report etcd server metrics under the `/metrics` path on its client port. Optionally, you can ediy location using `--listen-metrics-urls`. This integration only collects metrics from the Prometheus endpoint.

## Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

### Example

To activate this integration, add the following to your Collector configuration:

```
receivers:
  smartagent/etcd:
    type: etcd
    ... # Additional config
```

Next, add the monitor to the `service.pipelines.metrics.receivers` section of your configuration file:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/etcd]
```

### Configuration settings 

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `httpTimeout` | no | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `10s`) |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If `true`, the agent will connect to the server using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `httpHeaders` | no | `map of strings` | A map of HTTP header names to values. Comma separated multiple values for the same message-header is supported. |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is `true` and this option is also `true`, the exporter TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to `false`. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use for TLS required connections |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the exporter |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the exporter |
| `useServiceAccount` | no | `bool` | Use pod service account to authenticate. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricPath` | no | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually `/metrics` (the default). (**default:** `/metrics`) |
| `sendAllMetrics` | no | `bool` | Send all the metrics that come out of the Prometheus exporter without any filtering.  This option has no effect when using the prometheus exporter monitor directly since there is no built-in filtering, only when embedding it in other monitors. (**default:** `false`) |
