.. _ruby-otel-connector-requirement:

Can we add the commands here to check and see what version of Ruby the customer is currently running? This has been an issue with a handful of customers opening tickets about this issue.

Something like: You can check the version of Ruby you are running by running $ ruby -v or $ ruby --version to see if your version is currently compatible.

Install and configure the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector
==============================================================

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Ruby exports application traces and spans to the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector, which also collects system metric data and logs.

To send application traces and spans to Splunk Observability Cloud, install the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for your platform. The following distributions are available:

- Splunk OTel Collector for Linux. See :ref:`otel-install-linux`.
- Splunk OTel Collector for Windows. See :ref:`otel-install-windows`.
- Splunk OTel Collector for Kubernetes. See :ref:`otel-install-k8s`.
