Install and configure the SignalFx Smart Agent

So, unfortunately, this doc is somewhat confusing.

Under fstype - The filesystem types to include/exclude. This is an overridable set (https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#filtering-smart-agent)

If this is not set, the default value is the set of all non-logical/virtual filesystems on the system.

On Linux, this list is determined by reading the /proc/filesystems file and choosing the filesystems that do not have the nodev modifier.

So you can configure specific filesystem types, OR it will list "all" of the filesystems listed in the /proc/filesystems path.

You can add the nodev modifier to the ones that you don't want to show.

There is currently no way to do like "include:X" or "exclude:Y", unfortunately.

You either have to specifically specify what you want to show or it will show everything unless you configure it with your system's proc file.

   :description: The SignalFx Smart Agent provides automatic service discovery, configuration, and metrics collection for a variety of environments. The Smart Agent is deprecated as part of the release of Splunk Observability Cloud.

.. note:: The SignalFx Smart Agent has reached End of Support. While the agent can capture and export telemetry to Splunk Observability Cloud, Splunk no longer provides any support, feature updates, security, or bug fixes. Such requests are not bound by any SLAs.

The SignalFx Smart Agent gathers host performance, application, and service-level metrics from both containerized and non-container environments. This page provides a complete list of Smart Agent resources. Use your browser's search function to quickly find what you're looking for.

See :ref:`smart-agent-commands` for a list of the most commonly used commands for the SignalFx Smart Agent.

Components
============================================

The agent has three main components:

* Observers that discover applications and services running on the host. For a list of supported observers and their configurations, see :new-page:`observer configuration <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/observer-config.md>`.

* Monitors that collect metrics, events, and dimension properties from the host and applications. For a list of supported monitors and their configurations, see :new-page:`monitor configuration <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitor-config.md>`.

* The writer that sends the metrics, events, and dimension updates collected by monitors to Splunk Observability Cloud. The writer collects metrics emitted by configured monitors and sends them to Splunk Observability Cloud on a regular basis. You can configure :new-page:`writer settings <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/config-schema.md#writer>` in the configuration schema.

Use cases
===================================

The Smart Agent gathers metrics using monitors, including Python-based plugins such as Mongo, Redis, and Docker. See :ref:`supported-data-sources` for a list of data source integrations.

Use the Smart Agent to integrate with cloud services, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Kubernetes environments. See :ref:`get-started-connect`. Next, log in to Splunk Observability Cloud to view the incoming metrics in :ref:`dashboards` and :ref:`data-visualization-charts`.

Check out the health of your network and nodes using navigators. Some features of Splunk Observability Cloud such as :ref:`related content <get-started-relatedcontent>` do not work with the Smart Agent. To learn more, see :ref:`use-navigators-imm`.

The Smart Agent also supports receiving and sending trace data. See :ref:`apm-download-traces`.

Check exposed ports
=====================================================================

Before installing the Smart Agent, check exposed ports to make sure your environment doesn't have conflicts. You can change the ports in the Smart Agent configuration.

* Port 8095 is the default port that the internal status server listens on. Configure port 8095 using the ``internalStatusPort`` option.
* Port 9080 is the default port that the server listens on. Configure port 9080 using the ``listenAddress`` option. The ``listenAddress`` option is a configurable option for the ``trace-forwarder`` and ``signalfx-forwarder`` monitors.

The Smart Agent is incompatible on Linux systems with SELinux activated. Check the documentation for your distribution to learn how to deactivate SELinux.

.. note:: To uninstall the Smart Agent, see :ref:`uninstall-smart-agent`.

Configure the Smart Agent
==============================

You can configure the Smart Agent by editing the agent.yaml file. By default, the configuration is installed at and looked for at ``/etc/signalfx/agent.yaml`` on Linux and ``\ProgramData\SignalFxAgent\agent.yaml`` on Windows. You can override default locations using the ``-config`` command line flag.

The :new-page:`configuration schema <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/config-schema.md>` includes the options that you can use in the agent.yaml file to control the behavior of your integrations. :new-page:`Example.yaml <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/config-schema.md#example-yaml>` provides an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable. :new-page:`Remote configuration <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/remote-config.md>` describes how to configure the Smart Agent from remote sources, such as other files on the file system, or from key-value stores such as etcd.

Capture logs using the Smart Agent
====================================

The default log level is ``info``, which logs Smart Agent events without spamming the logs. Most of the ``info`` level logs are created upon startup and capture service discovery changes to record messages about routine operations. The ``debug`` log level creates verbose log output and should only be used when troubleshooting.

You can change the log level using the ``logging: {level: info}`` YAML configuration option. Other valid log levels include ``warn`` and ``error``.

The Smart Agent sends logs either as unstructured text (default) or JSON format. You can configure the Smart Agent to send JSON logs using the ``logging: {format: json}`` YAML configuration option.

Linux
-----------

The Smart Agent supports logging to ``stdout/stderr``, which is generally redirected by the init scripts provided to either a file at ``/var/log/signalfx-agent.log`` or to the systemd journal on newer distros.

Windows
------------

On Windows, the Smart Agent logs to the console when executed directly in a shell. If the Smart Agent is configured as a Windows service, log events are logged to the Windows Event Log. To read logs, select **Start**. Next, select **Administrative Tools**, then **Event Viewer**.

Activate proxy support in the Smart Agent
===========================================

To use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy, set the environment variable ``HTTP_PROXY`` or ``HTTPS_PROXY`` in the container configuration to proxy either protocol. The SignalFx ingest and API servers both use HTTPS. If the ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable exists, the Smart Agent automatically appends the local services to the environment variable to not use the proxy.

If the Smart Agent is running as a local service on the host, refer to the host documentation for information on passing environment variables to the Smart Agent service to activate proxy support when the service is started. For example, if the host services are managed by systemd, create the /etc/systemd/system/signalfx-agent.service.d/myproxy.conf file and add the following to the file:

.. code-block:: toml

   [Service]
   Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
   Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com:8081/"

After updating the file, run ``systemctl daemon-reload`` and ``systemctl restart signalfx-agent.service`` to restart the service with proxy support.

Sys-V based init.d systems: Debian and RHEL
---------------------------------------------

Create the /etc/default/signalfx-agent.yaml file with the following contents:

.. code-block::

   HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
   HTTPS_PROXY="https://proxy.example.com:8081/"

Smart Agent diagnostics
====================================

The Smart Agent serves diagnostic information on an HTTP server at the address configured by the ``internalStatusHost`` and ``internalStatusPort`` options. Use the ``signalfx-agent`` command status to read the server and extract its contents. Use the content to identify and resolve issues with the Smart Agent. The ``signalfx-agent`` command also explains how to get further diagnostic information.

Service discovery using the Smart Agent
===========================================

The Smart Agent includes a comprehensive service discovery feature. This feature allows the Smart Agent to identify each of the services within your environment and automatically configure the appropriate integration plugins from within its bundle. This is particularly valuable in large ephemeral container environments that experience high-churn and dynamic service creation, as new services are automatically discovered, installed, and configured within minutes. However, this capability is extended to non-containerized environments as well. See :new-page:`Service Discovery <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/auto-discovery.md>` for more information and configuration options.

.. _filtering-smart-agent:

Filtering data using the Smart Agent
====================================

Filter out certain data points or properties to prevent them from ever leaving the Smart Agent. Filtering can be useful to reduce clutter in charts without having to resort to filtering in the UI.

If possible, it is preferable to prevent the data points and properties you want to omit from being generated by a monitor in the first place, as this reduces CPU and memory usage of the Smart Agent, but sometimes this is not feasible.

See :new-page:`Filtering <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/filtering.md>` for more information and configuration options for Smart Agent 4.7.0+. See :new-page:`Legacy Filtering <https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/legacy-filtering.md>` for more information on the old style of filtering, which is deprecated and removed in Smart Agent 5.0+.
