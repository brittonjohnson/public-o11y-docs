.. note:: The SignalFx Smart Agent has reached End of Support. While the agent can capture and export telemetry to Splunk Observability Cloud, Splunk no longer provides any support, feature updates, security, or bug fixes. Such requests are not bound by any SLAs.

  Note that this only affects the agent; Smart Agent receivers bundled in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector are available and supported.
