    <li>In Incident Intelligence, select <span class="guilabel">Incident Management.</span></li>
    <li>Select the <span class="guilabel">On-call schedules</span> tab.</li>
    <li>Select <span class="guilabel">Create new schedule</span>.</li>
    <li>Select the pencil icon to edit the schedule name. Name your schedules so that they are easy to find when adding them to an incident workflow. For example, include a team name, a priority (for example, primary, secondary, and so on), and what is being covered (for example, database, web, and so on). Select the checkmark icon to save your schedule name.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Add a teams tag if you want to associate your schedule with a team. The teams tag makes finding a schedule in an incident workflow easier. It also sorts the team members at the top of the responder list when adding responders to your schedule shifts. To add a teams tag, enter the team name in the <span class="guilabel">Teams tag</span> field and select the team when it appears.</li>
    <li>
        Enter a shift name. Shift names often refer to time (for example, business hours, weekends, and so on).
    </li>
    <li>
        Select a shift start date. The shift begins on the day you select in <span class="guilabel">Shift starts on</span>. Shifts within the same can have independent start dates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the timezone picker to select the timezone for the coverage. The times in the schedule preview reflect this selection, not your local timezone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Define your shift coverage. As you configure a new shift, refer to the <span class="guilabel">Schedule Preview</span> to confirm that you configured your schedule as intended. The schedule preview includes schedule info for up to one year. Select <span class="guilabel">Next Month</span> and <span class="guilabel"></span>Previous Month</span> to navigate the schedule preview.</p>

                    <p>Week-by-week shifts are designed to span over one week and repeat every week.

        Under <span class="guilabel">Customize shift handoff</span>, select the number of shifts that you want to elapse before a handoff to the next team member in the schedule list. Increasing this number increases the number of times a responder is repeated in the schedule until the next responder is on call. For example, week-by-week coverage with a shift handoff of 2 creates a biweekly shift. Day-by-day coverage with a shift handoff of 2 keeps a responder on-call for 2 shift days until the next responder is on call.

    <li>
        Under <span class="guilabel">Add responders</span>, add one or more team members to the shift. You can add responders to a shift more than once.

                Enter team member names and select them when they appear. If you added a teams tag, the team members from this team are listed at the top of this menu. Select <span class="guilabel">Add all members from [TEAM]</span> to quickly add all the team members from that team. The <span class="guilabel">ALL</span> section of the team member list comes from the Observability Cloud user list.

    <li>
        Select <span class="guilabel">Save shift</span>. Shifts are added to the <span class="guilabel">SAVED SHIFTS</span> list under the schedule name. You must have at least one shift saved per schedule. To edit a previously-saved shift, select the pencil icon next to the shift. To delete a shift select the trash icon next to the shift.

    <li>
        Repeat these steps to add shifts to the schedule as needed. Select <span class="guilabel">Back to all schedules</span> when you are finished adding shifts to your on-call schedule.
