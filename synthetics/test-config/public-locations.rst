Public locations are global checkpoints from which you can run synthetic tests to simulate performance for users in that location. 

Splunk Synthetic Monitoring partners with infrastructure and connectivity providers around the world to create a global network of checkpoints from which to run tests. You can configure each of your tests to run from any or all of the available monitoring locations. 

The following table provides a full list of locations, available in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring, along with their DNS, region code, and IP address. You can use this information to exclude locations from your site analytics or add them to your browserâ€™s allow list.
