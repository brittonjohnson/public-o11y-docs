To simulate diverse types of traffic to your site or application, use a range of configuration options to customize each of your tests.

    <h2>Devices</h2>
  </embed>

When you set up a test in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring, you can configure the viewport and network connection of the device from which the test is simulated. 

Because Browser tests capture the visual experience of a page, while Uptime and API tests only capture response data, viewport applies to Browser tests only. Network connection applies to all test types.

    <h3>Viewport</h3>
  </embed>


Browser tests in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring capture the visual experience of a user interacting with your application. The viewport is the framed area on a deviceâ€™s screen for viewing information, such as the browser window on a desktop. By default, Browser tests run from a desktop-sized viewport. You can configure tests to run from other viewport sizes to test the user experience from a variety of window sizes and device types. 

When you set up a test, you can choose the viewport size from a list of common devices, or set a custom viewport by height and width.

    <h3>Network connection</h3>
  </embed>

You can run Browser, Uptime, or API tests to simulate network connections of various latencies, including Mobile LTE, Mobile 3G, DSL, Mobile 5G, and cable internet. Testing your site from a variety of connection types lets you monitor the experience of users in a variety of settings.

    <h2>Variables</h2>
  </embed>

Use variables to fill in fields, provide URLs, and enter other information during your tests. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80 

   * - :strong:`Variable type`
     - :strong:`Description`

   * - Custom variables
     - Custom variables are local to a test, and their values can change over the course of a test. Use them to store a value of interest created in a step, to be consumed in another step downstream in a single test. 
  
   * - Built-in variables 
     - Built-in variables such as random values, dates and times, or location names, for use in your Browser and API Tests. See :ref:`built-in-variables` to learn more.  

   * - Global variables 
     - Pre-saved, reusable variables you can define once and use across all your Browser and API tests. See :ref:`global-variables` to learn more.

    <h2>Locations</h2>
  </embed>


Specify locations for your tests to simulate traffic from a range of checkpoints around the world, or use private locations to test sites from within a private network.

For more, see: 

* :ref:`public-locations` 
* :ref:`private-locations`

.. * See :ref:`private-locations` to set up private locations.

    <h2>Test state and current status</h2>
  </embed>

You can use the play and pause buttons in the more menu (|more|) of your tests to pause or resume data collection. 

The current status of a test is updated every time you load the :guilabel:`Test Overview` page in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring. The following table describes the possible status types for each test. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20, 80

   * - :strong:`Current status`
     - :strong:`Description`

   * - Pending
     - Splunk Synthetic Monitoring is still retrieving the status of this test. 

   * - Available
     - The test is functioning properly. If the test is active, data is being collected at the set interval and can be viewed in the :guilabel:`Test History` page. If the test is paused, it can be unpaused and will resume collecting data.

   * - No Data 
     - The test isn't currently collecting data. 

   * - Failure
     - The test encountered a failure.

    <h2>Test naming conventions</h2>
  </embed>

Choosing informative names for your tests and alerts helps organize content. Here are some guidelines: 

* Add a category as a prefix to your test name like group, application, brand, or team names so that you can simplify searches. For example, these two Browser tests start with ``[ButtercupGames]``. 

* Add a description about the purpose of the test like the workflow, process, performance, or data source.

      :alt: This image shows two Browser tests with the prefix [ButtercupGames].

    <h2>Troubleshoot broken tests </h2>
  </embed>


Follow these guidelines to troubleshoot a broken test. 

#. (Optional) Make a copy of the test so that you can check various solutions before fixing the original test. 
#. Open the test page and see when the test started to fail. Consider the following questions:

    * When did the check fail? Is there a pattern among other failed runs?
    * Does the check fail consistently on the same step, or intermittently?
    * Is this the first time the check has failed on this step? Did you make a recent change to the test?
    * Was the failure tied to a specific location or across all locations? 

#. Open the run results view of a failed test, find the step that is failing and go to the link. 
#. Open inspect element. 
#. Duplicate the step and repeat the steps in your test until you find the broken step. 
#. Verify that there is one instance only of the selector you want to use in your test. If the selector appears more than once your test might break again in the future. Unique selectors provide optimal test performance. 
#. Update your tests with your findings.
