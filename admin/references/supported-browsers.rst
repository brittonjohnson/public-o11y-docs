   :description: Supported browsers for Splunk Observability Cloud. Use the latest and next-to-latest official releases of the following browsers: Chrome (recommended) and Safari.

Splunk Observability Cloud works as expected when using the latest and next-to-latest official releases of the following browsers:

- Chrome (recommended)
- Safari

An official release is a stable release and doesn't include alpha, beta, or release candidate releases.

For example, if the latest official major release of a supported browser is ``10`` and the next-to-latest release is ``9``, Observability Cloud works as expected when used with releases ``10`` and ``9``, including their official minor point releases.
