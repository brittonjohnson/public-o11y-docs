   Manage usage with access tokens <manage-usage>

Use authentication tokens to authenticate Splunk Observability Cloud API requests, track API usage, and control your use of resources.

Observability Cloud has two types of tokens:

* :ref:`admin-api-access-tokens` (also known as session tokens). These tokens are valid for a short period.
* :ref:`admin-org-tokens` (also known as org tokens). These tokens are valid for an extended period.

You can also use access tokens to manage usage. See :ref:`Manage data ingest using access tokens <admin-manage-usage>`.
