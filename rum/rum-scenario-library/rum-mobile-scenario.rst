Scenario: Kai finds the root cause of a user reported error in Splunk RUM for Mobile  
*************************************************************************************


The following scenario features Buttercup Industries, a fictitious e-commerce company.

About this scenario
================================

Buttercup Industries recently launched a mobile application. Kai, a site reliability engineer at Buttercup Industries, uses Splunk RUM for Mobile to monitor releases, find root causes of user reported issues, and measure important metrics. In this scenario, you can learn about how Kai leverages Splunk RUM for Mobile to monitor and improve the experience of the Buttercup Mobile app. 


Find the root cause of a user reported error 
================================================================

Sometimes, users report an issue in the app that requires a lot of digging to find the root cause. For example, if a user says the app isnâ€™t working, it can be tricky to find where to start troubleshooting. With Splunk RUM for Mobile, Kai can search for a the specific user session.

Splunk RUM Mobile captures:

    * every screen transition

    * app lifecycle events (app in foreground, background, app start times)

    * network requests

    * app errors and crashes

    * ability to :ref:`rum-custom-event`


Search for a specific session to identify a user reported error
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A user reported that the Buttercup Industries mobile app crashed during the checkout workflow. Kai uses Splunk RUM to trace  the user session all the way back to app launch so that they can advise the developers on how to reproduce the issue and fix the root cause.

Kai follows these steps to find a root cause of an error:

1. Kai opens RUM. From the left navigation panel, they select RUM then Mobile as the source. The following image shows the application summary dashboard which lists key metrics about the health of their application like:

    * App launches, errors, and crashes

    * Network requests and errors

    * App startup time

    * Detectors
